--Hacker News is a popular website run by Y Combinator. Itâ€™s widely known by people in the tech industry
--as a community site for sharing news, showing off projects, asking questions, among other things.
--In this project, we will be working with a table named hacker_news that contains stories from Hacker News
--since its launch in 2007.

--It has the following columns:
-- title: the title of the story
-- user: the user who submitted the story
-- score: the score of the story
-- timestamp: the time of the story
-- url: the link of the story

--Understanding of the dataset:
 SELECT *
 FROM hacker_news
 LIMIT 10;
--We see there's some columns with missing data
/*title	user	score	timestamp	url
coldtea		2014-01-27T17:31:13Z	
etanol		2011-10-23T18:46:40Z	*/

--Top 5 most popular Hacker News stories
 SELECT *
 FROM hacker_news
 ORDER BY score DESC
 LIMIT 5;

--Recent studies have found that online forums tend to be dominated by a small percentage of their users (1-9-90 Rule).
--Is this true of Hacker News? Is a small percentage of Hacker News submitters taking the majority of the points?
