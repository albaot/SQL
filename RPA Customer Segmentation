--RPA Customer Segmentation

--First I'm getting a feel for the 'users' table:
select *
from users
limit 10;
/*id	email	campaign	test	created_at	birthday
1	gchesshire0@ucoz.ru			2017-01-26	1982-04-17
2	rbritner1@is.gd			2017-10-08	1970-01-16
3	acoysh2@canalblog.com			2017-09-05	1986-08-11*/
--As we can see, there are some missing values in 2 of the columns (campaign and test)

--The marketing department wants to send a Born in the 80s email to the appropriate users
--Find the email addresses and birthdays of users whose birthday is between 1980-01-01 and 1989-12-31
select email, birthday
from users
where birthday between '1980-01-01' and '1989-12-31'
order by birthday;

--We are interested in the group of users that signed up prior to May 2017
--Find the emails and creation date of users whose created_at date matches this condition
select email, created_at
from users
where created_at < '2017-05-01'

--There was an A/B test performed on users that used cute animal clipart to encourage users to sign up
--Weâ€™d like to see how the group that was shown bears is performing
--Find the emails of the users who received the bears test
select email

where test = 'bears';

--4 advertising campaigns were run over this period. There were two sets of ad copy (set 1 and set 2)
--and both were run on two search engine sites (AAA and BBB). The resulting campaign values are:
--AAA-1
--AAA-2

select email

--Find all the emails of all users who received ad copy 2 in their campaign
select email

--Find the emails for all users who received both a campaign and a test
