--CODEFLIX

--A streaming video company, needs help analyzing their user data.
--The database contains 3 tables:
-- - users contains the basic account details for each user (id, first_name, last_name, email. password)
-- - payments contains payment details for a 3 month period (id, user_id, amount, status, pay_date)
-- - watch_history contains watch events for the users (id, user_id, watch_date, watch_in_duration_minutes)

--We want to determine the number of users that have an email ending in ‘.com’
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM users
WHERE email LIKE '%.com';

--What are the most popular first names on Codeflix? Display most popular names first
SELECT first_name, COUNT(*) AS popularity
FROM users
GROUP BY first_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC;

--The UX Research team wants to see a distribution of watch durations. They want the result to contain:
-- - duration (watch event duration, rounded to the closest minute)
-- - count (number of watch events falling into this “bucket”)
SELECT ROUND(watch_duration_in_minutes,0) AS duration, COUNT(watch_date) AS count
FROM watch_history
GROUP BY duration
ORDER BY duration;

--Find all the users that have successfully made a payment to Codeflix and find their total amount paid
--Sort them by their total payments (from high to low)
SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS total_paid
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY total_paid DESC;

--Generate a table of user ids and total watch duration for users who watched more than 400 minutes of content.
SELECT user_id, SUM(watch_duration_in_minutes) AS total_watch
FROM watch_history
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING total_watch > 400;

--To the nearest minute, how many minutes of content were streamed on Codeflix?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(watch_duration_in_minutes),0) AS total_minutes
FROM watch_history;

--Which days in this period did Codeflix collect the most money?
SELECT pay_date, SUM(amount) AS total_money
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'paid'
GROUP BY pay_date
ORDER BY total_money DESC;

--When users successfully pay Codeflix, what is the average payment amount?
SELECT AVG(amount) AS avg_payment
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'paid';

--Of all the events in the watch_history table, what is the duration of the longest individual watch event? What is the duration of the shortest?
SELECT MAX(watch_duration_in_minutes) AS longest_watch, MIN(watch_duration_in_minutes) AS shortest_watch
FROM watch_history;
