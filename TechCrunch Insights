-- TECHCRUNCH INSIGHTS

--It’s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.
--To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file that contains a table called startups.
--It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.

--First, let's take a look at the table
SELECT *
FROM startups;

-- This is the kind of data we will be working with:
/*name	location	category	employees	raised	valuation	founded	stage	ceo	info
Pied Piper	Silicon Valley	Cloud Computing	6	5000000	50000000	2014	A	Richard Hendricks	A Middle-Out Compression Solution
Hooli	Silicon Valley	Enterprise	9000	580000000	49500000000	1997		Gavin Bensen	Hooli Is About People*/

--Total number of companies
SELECT DISTINCT COUNT(name) AS total_companies
FROM startups;

--We want to know the total value of all companies
SELECT SUM(valuation) AS total_value
FROM startups;

--What are the highest and lowest amount raised by a startup?
SELECT name, MAX(raised) AS max_raised
FROM startups;
/*name	max_raised
REBU	11500000000*/

SELECT name, MIN(raised) AS max_raised
FROM startups;
/*name	min_raised
Fakeblock	3*/

--What is the maximum amount of money raised during ‘Seed’ stage?
SELECT name, MAX(raised) AS max_raised
FROM startups
WHERE stage = 'Seed';
/*name	max_raised_seed
Voice2Txt	1800000*/

--In what year was the oldest company on the list founded?
SELECT name, founded
FROM startups
ORDER BY 2
LIMIT 1;

--Let's find out the valuations among different sectors
--Average valuation in each category, round averages to 2 decimal places and order the list from highest averages to lowest.
SELECT ROUND(AVG(valuation),2) as avg_val
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_val DESC;

--What are the most competitive markets?
--Name of each category with the total number of companies that belong to each one of them
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS comp_by_cat
FROM startups
GROUP BY category;

--Now we only want to include categories that have more than 3 companies in them.
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS comp_by_cat
FROM startups
GROUP BY category
HAVING comp_by_cat > 3
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

--What are the most competitive markets?
/*category	comp_by_cat
Social	12
Mobile	10
Education	5*/
--The most competitive market is Social, Mobile and Education

--Are there any differences in startups sizes among different locations?

--First we're going to calculate the average size of a startup in each location:
SELECT location, ROUND(AVG(employees),0) AS avg_size
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY avg_size DESC;

-- Now we're going to calculate the average size of a startup in each location, with average sizes above 500
SELECT location, ROUND(AVG(employees),0) AS avg_size
FROM startups
GROUP BY location
HAVING avg_size > 500
ORDER BY avg_size DESC;

/*The results are:
location	avg_size
San Francisco	1920.0
Silicon Valley	1805.0
New York	703.0
Brooklyn	503.0*/
