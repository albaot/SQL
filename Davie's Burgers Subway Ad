--DAVIE'S BURGERS SUBWAY AD
--The restaurant business has been booming and it is now looking to place a catchy advertisement in the local subway station.
--Help them dig into their orders table to see if there is anything interesting in there for a funny tagline

--First, I'm going to get a feel for the orders table:
select *
from users
limit 10;
/*id	user_id	order_date	restaurant_id	item_name	special_instructions
1	43	2017-05-10	6	Beef Enchilada	ketchup
2	9	2017-06-30	3	Samosa	*/
--We can tell the column special_instructions has missing values

--If we wanted to see how recent the data is:
select distinct order_date
from orders
order by order_date;
--We see the orders go from 2017-05-03 to 2017-06-30

--We're going to rename the special instructions column as well as the id column:
select id as '#', special_instructions as 'notes'
from orders;
/*#	notes
...
15	Draw a dragon fighting flamingo on the pizza box.
16	The spider on the front porch is Frank. Frank guards the tomatoes. Be nice to Frank.
...*/

--Now with all these notes, the marketing team will choose the ones they think are the funniest and work out a subway ad out of them
